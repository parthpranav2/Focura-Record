CONSIDERATIONS
-number of question (totalQ = Parameter)
-each question type count (parameter)
-Serial number and question type should be properly mentioned in encapsulation. encapsulate int this format →(Question Format(abbreveation)"Serial number").eg(CLR_1"3")
-Response should contain question and answer in encapsulation.Question in box bracket [] and answer in curly brackets {}
-get the question answer set of all q in one go

For Paragraph Type Q (FPR_1,FPR_2)
-Word limit constrained paragraphs and based on decent topics which connect to all (topic = Parameter, word limit = Parameter)
-For the paragraph type q (FPR_1,FRP_2) provide the words which are used  and which are not used in the answer of that Q
  format = {IN-words
OUT-words}

For Sentence Type Q (CLR_1,CLR_2,CSF)
-Form senetnces based on WordLimit(Parameter)
-Suggest word from the sentence to show as blank space and ask from user ...Also suggest the words which are not in the sentnce (3 words)
format = {BLANK-words
OUT-words}
//{try suggesting words on the basis of simmilar pronounciation to create a auditory resolution challenge}

Our target is to get the question as well as expected answer based on our decided difficulty level and parameters of difficulty
