NOTE: * "Same kind" in the case of instruments means = instruments having same format of vibration/ sound generation 
      eg- Wind = shehnai, flute
          String = Guitar, Piano
          Percussion = Drum set, Tabla, Clap
      * We will not classify "Bass" in any music as they are present nearly in every track , so removing the bass will be the process which we have to perform for all tracks
        (api/Websit/Model URL = " " ,will try to perform this operation from the app dev end )
      *There will be some MIDI/Electronically generated components in music (beats) which we have to ignore... we are focussing on just the conventional instruments
        {include this kind of beats in percussion}
      *The processed wav file which will be used as input to the main instrument identifier model will not contain the vocals 
        ((will try to perform this operation from the app dev end)}


INPUT TYPE / Q TYPE :
{push type (a track will be played and the instrument which we have to odentofy will be mentioned. there will be a push button which the user will push when that instrumet 
is played. the time lag betweem the instrument played and tge user identiies it will be used to give points)}
{single correct}
{multibcorrect}

Pre filter for limitimg tracks search will be based on
-Beats Per Minute 

Easy
eg- 1.Tum hi ho (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umqb9KENgmk) -> 0:00-0:10
    2. Hamari adhuri kahani (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVRwZEkXepg) -> 0:00-0:39
    
(Classification)
- we just have to devide the instruments into Wind, String, Percussion
- No vocals
- 1-2 Instruments (EXCLUDING BASS)

(Expected Answer by user)
  -Type of instrument (wind, string, percussin/Leather)

(Interface)
-Single correct option type



Medium
A particular part of a track will be classified in this category if the highlightened instruments is that of a same kind
eg- 1.Luteron Ka Lutera | Kalank Title Cover (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktlHjOl5SMs) -> 0:00-1:30 {prominent instrument : strings}
    2.Yeh Tune Kya Kiya Song Once upon A Time In Mumbaai Dobara (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Qo6p4XsXE)  -> 0:00-2:00 {prominent instrument : percussion}
(Classification)
1.If there are vocals
- 2-3 instruments (EXCLUDING BASS)
-Identify exact or near exact instrument

(Idea for implementation)
-First we have to apply a model/api which will remove the vocals completely from the track (https://vocalremover.org/)
-Select the track which will have same kind of instruments playing 
-

(Interface)
-Single correct option type



Hard
(Classification)
eg- 1.Ilahi (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdubeMFwuGs)

-Multiple instruments of different types
-Vocals
-Speedy (Optional)
-Many instruments not playing throughout the track 
-Bass Significant

(Interface)
-Multicorrect option type
